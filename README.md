# Deep learning utilities library
## Installation

You can install **dlordinal** directly from the GitHub repository using the following command in your terminal:

    pip install git+https://github.com/ayrna/dlordinal.git@main

Also, you can clone the repository and then install the library from the local repository folder:
    
    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:ayrna/dlordinal.git
    pip install -e ~/dlordinal
    
Using the -e argument with pip install, does an editable installation, allowing the changes obtained through the repository to be automatically applied to the installed version of the library.
